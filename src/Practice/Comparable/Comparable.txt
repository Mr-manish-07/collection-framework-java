1.Comparable is  used for natural order sorting but when we required to custom logic for sorting such as
    sort is by name , by age then check something and then sort by id etc.
    But when we have compare with any of the field/variable inside the class so we write Comparable

2.There is a compareTo method inside Comparable Interface when class need to sort by natural order
    then we need to override that abstract method inside interface.

3.It takes int value as a return type if the return value is -1 then arrange in same order/ascending if return
    value is 0 then keep it as it is.

4.If the value is 1 then arrange it into descending order

5.We just need to call list.sort() , it will automatically find compareTo method and get return type then sort it.

6.But when we use comparator we need to pass comparator in the argument of list.sort(), if there is any integer , float
    or any wrapper class we can pass null as argument, and it will sort it into natural order.

7.In list.sort(null) if there is any comparable is being inherited on that condition compareTo method will run
    behind the seen for sorting. But if there is no comparable then it requires comparator there.
    In comparable we can pass null for natural ordering but with comparator it is only possible when we haven't custom
    class or it works only on wrapper classes not with custom class.
