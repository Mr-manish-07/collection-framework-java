It is the subclass of hashMap means it extends hashmap, there is some difference it both of them
    a. LinkedHashMap uses doubly linked list so the order is being maintained
    b. We can pass initial capacity ,loadFactor,accessOrder.
    c. AccessOrder : If its true then access element will go to last of the list due to tracking of least used
                     element for deletion.

We can use HashMap's value to implement LinkedHashMap

Neither HashMap nor LinkedHashMap is thread safe.

Whenever we put values then removeEldestEntry is called automatically for deleting not used item at very top.
    By default this method return false so we need to override to use in our implementation.
