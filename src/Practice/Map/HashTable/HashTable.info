1. HashTable Implement Map interface , it is thread safe it uses multithreading.
    It is synchronized.
2. So it is slower in nature due to overhead.
3. It is no longer used now it is being replaces with concurrentHashMap.
4. Neither key nor value could be null
5. Operation is same as hashMap
6. It doesn't uses only linked List in case of collision (no red black is used).
